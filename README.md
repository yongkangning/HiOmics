# Code for HiOmics Platform tools

The ID in front of the folder corresponds to the link ID of the tool on the website(https://www.henbio.com/tools).

In each folder, files with .R or .py extensions represent the core code for each tool, while files with .wdl and .json extensions represent the workflow code submitted to Cromwell.
